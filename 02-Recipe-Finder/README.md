# 🍲 Recipe Finder

A responsive React application that allows users to browse, search, and filter recipes fetched from a mock backend powered by JSON Server. The project demonstrates modern React concepts such as data fetching with Axios, custom hooks, loading and error states, debounced search, and component-based architecture.

---

## 📖 Overview

Recipe Finder enables users to:

* Browse a collection of recipes
* Search recipes by name or ingredients
* Filter recipes by cuisine
* View detailed recipe information
* Experience professional loading skeletons during data fetching
* Handle API errors gracefully
* Enjoy smooth animations and responsive layouts

This project serves as an introduction to frontend-backend communication and asynchronous data handling in React applications.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Presentation Layer

Responsible only for rendering UI.

* RecipeCard
* SkeletonCard
* SearchBar
* FilterBar

### Container Layer

Responsible for state management and orchestration.

* HomePage

### Data Layer

Responsible for API communication and data fetching.

* api/recipeApi.js
* hooks/useRecipes.js

This separation improves maintainability, reusability, and scalability.

## ⚙️ Installation

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd recipe-finder
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Install JSON Server Globally

```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

---

## 📦 Required Dependencies

```bash
npm install axios
npm install bootstrap
npm install framer-motion
npm install lucide-react
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

### Start JSON Server

```bash
json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
```

The API will be available at:

```text
http://localhost:5000/recipes
```

### Start React Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will run at:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

## 📚 React Concepts Demonstrated

### useEffect

Used for:

* Fetching data on component mount
* Managing side effects
* Cleanup functions

### useRef

Used for:

* Debounce timer storage
* Mutable values without re-renders

### Custom Hooks

Used to:

* Encapsulate API logic
* Reuse stateful behavior
* Improve code organization

### Derived State

Filtered recipes are computed from:

```javascript
recipes + searchTerm + selectedCuisine
```

instead of storing duplicate state.

### Async Data Lifecycle
